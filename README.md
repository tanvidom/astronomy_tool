# Design Documentation 

This game was designed during the MIT Design Camp held in 2017 January. The CLIx Astronomy Team and MIT Curriculum Team was involved in pedagogy behind the game and its conceptional design. 


# Future Scope 

Their is a lot of scope in further development of this game. Presently there are only 8 clues which have already been decided, but if teachers/ educators or developers have other clues they can be embedded in this game as well. An authoring interface can be designed so that teachers can use this interface to design thei own activity and use their creativity to enhance learning objective of the tools. The screen size and resolution of the game can also be increased so as to fit different screen sizes.
